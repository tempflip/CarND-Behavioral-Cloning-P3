# Project summary

##Files

My project includes the following files:
* model.py.ipynb *This is a jupyter notebook* At the end of the notebook, there is a code for visualization, so after the model.save() statemend it is not strictly the part of the project.
* drive.py 
* model.h5 
* writeup_report.md 
* video.mp4

##Submission

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```
The final video is also included (video.mp4) as well as on youtube:
